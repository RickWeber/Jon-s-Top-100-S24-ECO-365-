# Jon's ECO 365 final project (S24)

Using the hot 100 billboard CSV file that webscraped from 1958 to 2021, I developed a code that through this file you will be able to see the top 5 songs and artist of each year based on the amount of weeks charted number 1. The way the code works is that is calls in the data, then a function is created for the input year. The function filters the year so that it goes to the input year and is arranged based on the peak rank which would be number 1. After we call the top 5 songs and artist in that peak rank and it gives the weeks they charted number 1. Lastly there is a return function so that you can continuously use the function for a different year. You should care because if your taking with a friend and are arguing on who was the better artist during a specific year, within seconds you will be able to obtain that data through this code. Throughout trying to do this project I learned alot about how difficult it is to webscrape and need to further my knowledge on it more when it comes to more complex scraping. I wanted to webscrape and grab data from wikipedia or billboards itself, but anything I tried would not work and I kept getting http 404 errors. Even though, I wasn't able to webscrape through the stuff i learned from the datacamps I was able to come up with this code that still did the task I was trying to achieve.
